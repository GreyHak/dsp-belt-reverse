### v1.1.1
 - Updated button position to deconflict with new Memo Icon game feature.

 - Reversing a belts direction will no longer send half the items on the belt to Icarus' inventory.  The mod now attempts to maintain the position of cargo on the belt.

 - Rebuild required for the recent Dyson Sphere Program [0.6.17.5932 update](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1366540/view/4178750236020840924).
